## Indexing Q
- How indexing affects performance? UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT
- Usecase: index overlapping
- Usecase: read explain analyze result
- Multiple indexes available, optimizer will choose the best one
    - How?
    - Can we force the optimizer to use a specific index? 
- SQL execution order: WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT
- Behind the scene, how is pattern matching using LIKE intepreted? 
    - `x like 'abc%'` => `x >= 'abc' and x < 'abd'`
    - work same as range query, index also works the same way as range query
