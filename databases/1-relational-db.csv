What are the key properties of relational databases?,multiple-choice,Speed and efficiency,"Consistency, durability, integrity",Complexity and scalability,Atomicity and isolation,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Relational databases are characterized by key properties such as consistency, durability, and integrity, as mentioned in the image.",Information Technology
What does ACID stand for in the context of databases?,multiple-choice,"Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability","Accuracy, Completeness, Integrity, Durability","Atomicity, Completeness, Isolation, Dependability","Accuracy, Consistency, Isolation, Dynamics",,,,,,,,,,,,1,"ACID is an acronym used in the context of databases for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, ensuring reliable transaction processing.",Information Technology
Data in relational databases is stored and represented in:,multiple-choice,Objects and methods,Files and documents,Rows and columns,Blocks and chains,,,,,,,,,,,,3,Relational databases store and represent data in a structured format of rows and columns.,Information Technology
What does the property of 'Atomicity' ensure in transactions?,multiple-choice,Transactions are divisible.,All statements within a transaction take effect or none.,Transactions are consistent.,Transactions can be isolated.,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Atomicity' ensures that all parts of a transaction are completed; if any part fails, the entire transaction fails, ensuring no partial transactions.",Information Technology
Which ACID property is described by 'start transaction' and 'commit'?,multiple-choice,Isolation,Consistency,Atomicity,Durability,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Start transaction' and 'commit' are part of the 'Atomicity' property, which ensures transactions are all-or-nothing.",Information Technology
What is the importance of 'Consistency' in databases?,multiple-choice,Ensures transactions are fast,Prevents data duplication,Data will never become incorrect,Protects against data breaches,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Consistency' in databases ensures that data remains accurate and in accordance with all defined rules, including data constraints.",Information Technology
Which property of ACID refers to the visibility of transaction changes to others?,multiple-choice,Atomicity,Durability,Isolation,Consistency,,,,,,,,,,,,3,The 'Isolation' property in ACID determines how and when the changes made by one transaction are made visible to other transactions.,Information Technology
Durability' in ACID means:,multiple-choice,Transactions are reversible,Changes survive outages once a transaction commits,Data is only temporarily stored,Transactions can be performed rapidly,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Durability' ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a power loss, crash, or error.",Information Technology
What does 'data durability' mean?,multiple-choice,Data can be accessed at any time,Data does not require backups,Data survives outages after transaction commits,Data is flexible and can change easily,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Data durability means that once a transaction is committed, the changes it has made to the data will persist even in the case of a system failure.",Information Technology
Which property of ACID would you exercise if you 'insert into posts values(â€¦)' and then 'update stats set total_posts = total_posts + 1 where user_id = 100'?,multiple-choice,Atomicity,Durability,Consistency,Isolation,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"The 'Atomicity' property is exercised in this scenario, ensuring that either both statements are executed successfully or neither is, to maintain data integrity.",Information Technology
Relational databases are recommended for:,multiple-choice,Simple data storage,Relations and ACID properties,Non-relational data structures,Temporary data handling,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Relational databases are recommended for their support of relations and ACID properties, which are crucial for data integrity and correct application behavior.",Information Technology
What should be true for changes done at one line in Transaction 1 to be visible to Transaction 2?,multiple-choice,Transaction 1 should rollback,Transaction 2 should commit,Transaction 1 should commit,Transaction 2 should rollback,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"For changes in one transaction to be visible to another, the first transaction must commit its changes.",Information Technology
