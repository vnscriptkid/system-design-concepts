### Exercise 1: Implementing Lazy Caching
Scenario: You have an API endpoint that retrieves user profiles from a database. Implement a lazy cache to improve performance.

Concept: Lazy population strategy.

Walkthrough:

Set up a cache using Redis.
Modify the API endpoint to first check the cache for the requested user profile using the user ID as the key.
If the profile is not found in the cache, retrieve it from the database.
Store the retrieved profile in the cache and set an appropriate expiry time.
Return the user profile.
### Exercise 2: Caching Database Queries
Scenario: Your application frequently runs a complex query that joins several tables. Cache the result to reduce the database load.

Concept: Lazy population strategy.

Walkthrough:

Identify the complex query.
Before executing the query, create a hash of the query string to use as a cache key.
Look up the cache to see if the result of the query is already stored.
If not, execute the query, cache the result, and set an expiration time.
Use the cached data for subsequent requests.
### Exercise 3: Cache Invalidation
Scenario: When a user updates their profile, ensure the cache is invalidated to reflect the changes.

Concept: Cache coherence.

Walkthrough:

When a profile update API call is made, update the database.
Immediately invalidate the cache entry for that user's profile.
The next time the profile is requested, the cache will be repopulated with the updated data.
### Exercise 4: Eager Caching Implementation
Scenario: A new product is launching, and you expect high traffic on the product details page. Implement eager caching for this scenario.

Concept: Eager population strategy.

Walkthrough:

Preload the product details into the cache before the launch.
When the product details are updated in the database, simultaneously update the cache.
Ensure that any API call for the product details first checks the cache.
### Exercise 5: Database and Cache Synchronization
Scenario: Your application allows users to post comments. Make sure the cache and the database are always in sync after a new comment is posted.

Concept: Eager population strategy.

Walkthrough:

Set up a mechanism to listen for new comments being posted.
As soon as a comment is posted, update the database.
Update the cache immediately after the database update.
### Exercise 6: Vertical Cache Scaling
Scenario: The current cache instance is reaching memory capacity. Scale it vertically to handle the increased load.

Concept: Vertical scaling.

Walkthrough:

Choose a larger cache instance with more memory and CPU resources.
Migrate the existing cache data to the new instance.
Update your application configuration to use the new cache instance.
### Exercise 7: Horizontal Cache Scaling with Read Replicas
Scenario: You want to scale out the reads for your cache across multiple instances.

Concept: Horizontal scaling with replicas.

Walkthrough:

Create read replicas for your cache.
Distribute read requests among the primary and replica caches.
Implement a load balancer if necessary to manage the distribution.
### Exercise 8: Implementing Cache Sharding
Scenario: You need to scale write operations across multiple cache instances because of high write volume.

Concept: Sharding.

Walkthrough:

Partition the cache space into shards based on a sharding key (e.g., user ID).
Write data to the appropriate shard based on the sharding key.
Ensure that each shard is managed independently to distribute the load.
### Exercise 9: Cache Hit and Miss Analysis
Scenario: Analyze the cache performance by monitoring cache hits and misses.

Concept: Cache hit/miss ratio.

Walkthrough:

Implement logging for each cache access to record whether it was a hit or a miss.
Use a monitoring tool to visualize the hit vs. miss ratio.
Optimize the cache configuration based on the analysis to improve the hit ratio.
### Exercise 10: Proactive Cache Warming
Scenario: A celebrity is about to tweet, which will drive traffic to their profile on your site. Proactively warm up the cache with their profile data.

Concept: Proactive caching.

Walkthrough:

Monitor the celebrity's account for new tweets.
When a tweet is detected, immediately retrieve the celebrity's profile from the database.
Store the profile in the cache before the traffic surge occurs.
These exercises can be performed in a controlled development environment, allowing you to observe the effects of caching strategies and scaling techniques firsthand. For a complete learning experience, you should also monitor performance metrics such as response times and system load before and after implementing caching.


### Exercise 11: Cache Eviction Policy Implementation
Scenario: Implement a cache eviction policy to remove least recently used items when the cache is full.

Concept: Cache eviction policy.

Walkthrough:

Configure your cache to use an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy.
Load the cache until it reaches capacity to trigger the eviction process.
Access various keys and observe the eviction of the least recently used items.

### Exercise 12: Redis Pub/Sub for Cache Invalidation
Scenario: Use Redis's publish/subscribe (pub/sub) feature to invalidate cache entries in a microservices architecture.

Concept: Cache invalidation in distributed systems.

Walkthrough:

Set up a Redis pub/sub channel for cache invalidation messages.
When a service updates data, have it publish an invalidation message.
Other services subscribed to the channel should listen for invalidation messages and clear the relevant cache entries accordingly.

### Exercise 13: Cache Dependency Management
Scenario: Cache complex query results that depend on multiple tables, and invalidate the cache when any related data changes.

Concept: Cache dependencies.

Walkthrough:

Identify all tables involved in the complex query.
Create a cache entry for the query result with a unique key.
Set up triggers or notifications for changes in any of the dependent tables.
Invalidate the cache entry when a change is detected in any of the tables.

### Exercise 14: Load Testing with Caching
Scenario: Conduct load testing on your application to compare performance with and without caching.

Concept: Performance testing with caching.

Walkthrough:

Set up a testing environment that mirrors production.
Conduct load testing without caching and record performance metrics.
Enable caching and repeat the load test.
Compare the metrics to measure the impact of caching on performance.

### Exercise 15: Implementing Cache Warm-Up Strategies
Scenario: Design a strategy to warm up the cache after a deployment or restart.

Concept: Cache warming.

Walkthrough:

Identify the most frequently accessed data.
On application start-up or after deployment, pre-load this data into the cache.
Monitor the cache hit rate post-deployment to ensure the warm-up was effective.

### Exercise 16: Horizontal Scaling - Adding a Cache Shard
Scenario: Your application's user base has grown, and the cache is experiencing increased write loads. Add a new shard to the cache.

Concept: Sharding for scalability.

Walkthrough:

Determine a suitable sharding key (e.g., geographical location, user ID range).
Set up a new cache instance to serve as a shard.
Configure the cache client to route writes to the correct shard based on the sharding key.

### Exercise 17: Automatic Cache Failover
Scenario: Implement an automatic failover mechanism for the cache layer to switch to a replica in case the primary cache node fails.

Concept: Cache reliability and high availability.

Walkthrough:

Configure multiple cache replicas.
Implement a health check system to monitor the status of the primary cache node.
Automatically switch to a replica if the primary node fails.

### Exercise 18: Cache Consistency Checks
Scenario: Periodically check the consistency between the cache and the database to ensure data integrity.

Concept: Cache consistency.

Walkthrough:

Select a sample of keys from the cache.
Fetch the corresponding data from both the cache and the database.
Compare the data to ensure they are consistent.
If inconsistencies are found, synchronize the cache with the database.

### Exercise 19: API Rate Limiting with Caching
Scenario: Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse by caching request counts per user or IP.

Concept: Cache-aided rate limiting.

Walkthrough:

Use the cache to store and update the count of API requests per user/IP.
Set a limit for the number of allowed requests in a given time frame.
Check the cache on each request to determine if the limit has been reached.
If the limit is exceeded, deny the request.

### Exercise 20: Caching Content for SEO Crawling
Scenario: Optimize the response time for SEO crawlers by caching static content.
